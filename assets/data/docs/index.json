NumberNine is nothing more than that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"its-symfony-after-all\"><a href=\"#its-symfony-after-all\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>It's Symfony after all</h2>\n<p>NumberNine comes in the form of a set of Symfony bundles and libraries.</p>\n<p>Although it takes control of some key aspects of the framework such as the security layer, your directory structure\ndon't include code that isn't yours. NumberNine gives you an empty <code>/src</code> directory for you to work in. </p>\n<p>You can still use Symfony the way you're used too. If you need a custom route, custom controller, whatever you want,\ntake over and let it be Symfony.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/architecture/symfony/\">Learn more about how NumberNine complements Symfony...</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"no-configuration\"><a href=\"#no-configuration\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>No configuration</h2>\n<p>Using NumberNine's installer, you won't have anything to configure.\nNo yaml or php file to edit. Just launch your website, and you're good to go.</p>\n<p>What's more? NumberNine don't mess with Symfony configuration files.\nIt automatically configures everything for you. If you need to change a setting, override it\nin your app yaml files, it's Symfony after all!</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-management\"><a href=\"#user-management\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>User management</h2>\n<p>Like any CMS on the market, NumberNine features an extended user management system.\nIt natively handles login, registration, roles and capabilities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/architecture/user-management/\">Learn more about user management...</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"shortcodes-and-components-as-services\"><a href=\"#shortcodes-and-components-as-services\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Shortcodes and components as services</h2>\n<p>Extend your theme with business logic by creating new shortcodes.</p>\n<p>In NumberNine, shortcodes are represented by text in the content of the page by this syntax:\n<code>[my_custom_shortcode]</code>.\nIn your code, it's just a service class, where you can inject any dependency like you're used to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/architecture/theming/#components\">Learn more about shortcodes and components...</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"block-presets\"><a href=\"#block-presets\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Block presets</h2>\n<p>NumberNine uses a \"everything is a shortcode\" architecture, or more exactly \"everything can be a shortcode\".\nIn addition, you can create preconfigured templates of small parts of your website to reuse anywhere.\nFor instance, you can create several preconfigured headers from which your client can choose. </p>\n<h2 id=\"theme-overriding\"><a href=\"#theme-overriding\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Theme overriding</h2>\n<p>Any part of a theme is overridable in your <code>/src</code> directory, be it twig templates or shortcodes classes.\nThis allows you to create very quickly child themes to give a unique feel to your project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/architecture/theming/\">Learn more about theming...</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"event-driven-lifecycle\"><a href=\"#event-driven-lifecycle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Event-driven lifecycle</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Symfony's <code>EventDispatcher</code>, NumberNine is a piece of cake to extend.
