You can at anytime <strong>override any setting</strong> like you usually do\nwith Symfony.</p>\n<p>Symfony's documentation is 100% valid for NumberNine, although you don't need to touch\nthe security config unless you have a very specific need for it. NumberNine already\ncreates the user management layer so you don't have to go through all steps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-dispatcher\"><a href=\"#event-dispatcher\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Event dispatcher</h2>\n<p>NumberNine makes extensive use of Symfony's event dispatcher to allow extending its features\nfrom your own code without having to modify the core code.</p>\n<p>You'll be able to add or modify user capabilities, route templates, custom post types, and much more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"micro-controllers\"><a href=\"#micro-controllers\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Micro-controllers</h2>\n<p>In a classic Symfony application, a page is rendered with a single controller and a single template.\nIt's fine, but hardly reusable.</p>\n<p>In NumberNine, you can create <strong>components</strong> and <strong>shortcodes</strong> that will handle a small region of\nyour page with an isolated controller and a specific template for this region, with virtually no\nperformance impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/architecture/theming/\">Learn more about theming...</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"custom-routes\"><a href=\"#custom-routes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Custom routes</h2>\n<p>You don't have to code your app \"the NumberNine way\", as there's no \"NumberNine way\".
